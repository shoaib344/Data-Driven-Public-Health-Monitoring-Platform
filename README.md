## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end system for ingesting, storing, analyzing, and visualizing time-series public health and environmental data. It includes: real-time data ingestion, time-series storage, ML forecasting, geospatial dashboards, role-based access, and alerting (email/push).

The repository is structured to look and behave like a startup MVP suitable for technical interview demos and portfolio presentations.

# Key Features

Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources (APIs / simulated sensors).

Time-series storage (TimescaleDB or InfluxDB) with relational user data in PostgreSQL.

ML models to forecast short-term risk (air quality / outbreak risk) using Python (scikit-learn / TensorFlow).

Interactive map overlays (Mapbox / Leaflet) and charts (D3 / Recharts).

Role-based access (public users, authority/admin) with secure authentication (JWT / OAuth).

Alerts & notifications (email, push, in-app) when thresholds or predictions indicate elevated risk.

CI/CD pipeline, Dockerized services, and infrastructure-as-code examples for cloud deployment (AWS / Azure).
