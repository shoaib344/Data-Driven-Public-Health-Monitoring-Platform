Project Idea 3: Data-Driven Public Health Tracker with Predictive Alerts

One-Sentence Description:
A platform aggregating public health / environmental data (e.g. air quality, disease outbreaks, hospital capacity), visualising trends, and giving predictive alerts / recommendations to citizens or local authorities.

Real-World Use-Case:
Cities or local authorities want to monitor environmental health indicators to issue warnings (e.g. pollution peaks, infectious disease risks), plan resource allocation, and inform citizens proactively. Citizens want dashboards for their area, alerts for bad air days or outbreak risk, suggestions for behavior based on predictive models.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js (React + TypeScript) or Vue with SSR/static generation options

Backend: Python (Flask or Django) or Node.js; data ingestion pipeline for APIs + streaming data (e.g. environmental sensors or public health open data)

Database: Time-series DB (e.g. InfluxDB or TimescaleDB) for sensor/time-based data + relational DB for user/accounts etc.

ML / Prediction: Use Python (scikit-learn / TensorFlow or PyTorch) to build predictive models (e.g. forecasting air quality or outbreak risk)

Real-Time/Streaming: WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE) to push live updates/alerts

Infrastructure: Cloud services (AWS or Azure); containerization; use serverless for parts of ingestion; ensure scalability and reliability

Visualization: Interactive charts, maps (leaflet / Mapbox), data exploration UI; maybe dashboards for different kinds of users (public vs authority)

Advanced Features:

Live/real-time data updating, alerting when thresholds are exceeded (e.g. email/push messages)

Predictive model that forecasts upcoming days’ risk levels

Geospatial visualizations & filtering by user location (map overlays etc.)

Multi-user roles: general public, health authority / admin with different dashboards & permissions

Multi-step pipelines: ingestion → cleaning → storage → analysis/prediction → notification

Secure access, API for external access, maybe mobile PWA for on the go

How to Pitch on Resume:

“Built a Data-Driven Public Health Monitoring Platform aggregating real-time environmental & disease data, with predictive risk alerts, geospatial dashboards, map overlays, and role-based access. Stack: Next.js (TS) + Python ML, TimescaleDB/InfluxDB, deployed on AWS with streaming, CI/CD, secure practices. Demonstrated end-to-end data engineering, modeling, and real-world value.”
